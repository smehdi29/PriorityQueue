# PriorityQueue

Made by Syed Mehdi in CS251 Fall 2022


Abstraction of a data structure in C++ that creates a priority queue using Binary Search Trees but modified to accommodate duplicates.
Developed the BST in way such that each node was basically the head of a linked list to allow us to consider duplicates. 
Developed processes such as enqueue and dequeue.
